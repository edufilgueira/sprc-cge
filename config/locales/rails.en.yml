  undefined: The elaboration of the Pluriannual Plan (PPA) occurs in the first year of the management and will subsidize the planning for the next four years that will follow. It is a time when all the state public institutions of the three Powers idealize the results to be achieved and what they will do to reach them. In addition, the participation of the population in this initial moment is of great importance to direct the governmental plans that are to come.

  elaborating: |
    The preparation of the Pluriannual Plan (PPA) occurs in the first year of
    management and will subsidize the planning for the next four years that will
    follow. It is a time when all state public institutions, from the three branches
    of government, idealize the results to be achieved and what they will do to
    achieve them. In addition, the participation of the population in this initial
    moment is of great importance to direct the government plans to come.
  evaluating: |
    The evaluation of the Pluriannual Plan, which is valid for four years, occurs every two
    years of execution. It is at this moment that it is analyzed whether the expected impacts at the time of
    planning are actually being achieved and if society's demands are being met,
    as set out in the regional guidelines. Citizen participation is essential in this
    process, since it guides the government on the need for possible redirections or
    prioritizing specific regional strategies, so that the best
    way to obtain the results expected by the population, considering the characteristics
    of each planning region.
  monitoring: |
    The monitoring of the PPA is a continuous process of qualitative and quantitative
    monitoring of the actions planned by the government that aims to identify and
    correct deviations in execution and improve the allocation of resources. It is
    important that society participates in this moment in order to verify if the
    regional strategies defined by the population are being carried out satisfactorily,
    in order to promote the achievement of the results declared in the Plan.
  revising: |
    The revision of the Pluriannual Plan (PPA) occurs every four years, in the second
    year of execution of the current Plan, and seeks to establish the Government's
    priorities and goals for its last two years. Based on an assessment of the current
    situation in each region, it is possible to reorient the State's policies, defining
    new goals and priorities, or to maintain those that were defined during the elaboration.
    The participation of the population at this time is essential to redirect, according
    to the needs, the priorities for each region.
