              <p> See here the registered revenue, which is registered after the taxpayer has been identified, the event that generates the obligation and the amount to be paid. </ p> <p> Available Revenues are related to Property Tax on Automotive Vehicles - IPVA. Currently, there is viability for accounting registration and disclosure in the Pages of Transparency of the Registered and Charged values related to IPVA. As for other state taxes, considering the tax and accounting system in force, it is concluded that it is unfeasible to present its proceeds. The Cear√° State Treasury Department is awaiting definition of a national standard to know what accounting procedures will be necessary to make available the other registered tax revenues. From general methodology definition, SEFAZ and CGE will make all necessary efforts to fully comply with the system to be defined. </p>
